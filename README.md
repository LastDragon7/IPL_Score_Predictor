# Beginner Machine Learning Project

Project Overview
Welcome to my first foray into the exciting world of Machine Learning! This project serves as an introduction to some fundamental regression models. Through this project, I aim to understand the basics of model implementation, evaluation, and comparison.


Models Implemented
In this project, I have explored and implemented the following regression models:
1.Linear Regression
2.Decision Tree Regressor
3.Random Forest Regression


Performance Summary
After training and evaluating all three models, the Random Forest Regression model emerged as the top performer, delivering the best results on the test dataset.
